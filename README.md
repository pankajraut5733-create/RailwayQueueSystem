# Railway Queueing System

## B.Tech CSE Mini Project — C Language

---

# Project Overview

The Railway Queueing System is a console-based mini project developed using the C programming language.
This project demonstrates modular programming and GitHub collaboration using C language.
This project simulates a railway reservation and passenger management system using different data structures such as Queue, Stack, Linked List, and Structures.

The system allows passengers to:

* Book train tickets
* Join waiting lists
* Access emergency/priority booking
* Cancel tickets
* View train details

The project follows modular programming concepts by dividing the system into multiple `.c` and `.h` files.

# Data Structures Used

## Queue (FIFO)

Used for normal passenger booking.

## Stack (LIFO)

Used for emergency and priority passengers.

## Linked List

Used for dynamic waiting list management.

## Structures

Used for storing passenger and train details.

# GitHub Collaboration

* All group members were added as collaborators to the GitHub repository.
* Collaboration requests were accepted by all members.
* Each member made meaningful commits to the project repository.
* The project follows modular programming practices.

---

# File Handling

Passenger booking data is stored using CSV files:

* passengers.csv
* waiting.csv
* emergency.csv

This ensures that passenger information is stored properly.

---

# Compilation Command

```bash
gcc main.c queue.c emergency.c waiting_list.c train.c file_handling.c -o railway
```

---

# Run Command

## Windows

```bash
railway.exe
```

## Linux / Mac

```bash
./railway
```
